# What we want to achieve...

- We want to provide a set of functions that can be used from web and also from standalone application.
- Let's start by providing a fibonacci function.

# Steps

- [x] the first step is to have it working as a standalone application
- [x] then try to run into into web
- [x] and adds imports functions as well...

# Conclusion

- We have:
    - `fibo.zig`: is the naive implementation of fibonacci sequence in Zig
    - This file can be compiled as an object file and called from either:
        - `app_fibo.zig`: a standalone application in Zig
        - `node_fibo.js`: that loads the `fibo.wasm` file generated from the same `fibo.zig` code.

- You can test is by running `make all`
    - then run the standalone app: `./app_fibo`
    - or run the web app `node node_fibo.js`

- WIP: implement an HTTP server to run our `fibo.wasm` file...
